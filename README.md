# png-decoder
A simple PNG (Portable Network Graphic) decoder written in plain JavaScript without using any libraries.I wrote this as a learning exercise and is one of my earlier projects and is badly organized and unreadable. 
I wrote this as i was curious about how file compression works.I learned a lot while writing this, implemented functions to decompress  data compressed using DEFLATE (lossless data compression algorithm involving a combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding).
